# 📝 Handwritten Digit Recognition (ANN)

## 📌 Overview
The **Handwritten Digit Recognition System** is a deep learning-based model that classifies handwritten digits (0-9) using a dataset collected from **Kaggle**. The model leverages an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to achieve high accuracy in digit classification.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of handwritten digit dataset from Kaggle  
- ANN model for digit classification  
- Training and evaluation with accuracy metrics
  
## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
